Hello there!

# How to Play?

First, you must choose a difficulty (easy to hard, table gets bigger by difficulty).
After that, you will see the Nonogram table for the chosen difficulty.
Then, you have to enter 3 integer values.

- First one is option. The option is that would you rather fill a spot or clean it.
- Row
- Column

By following these steps, you can finish the game!

I will try to find bugs to patch them, but if you find any please let me know.
